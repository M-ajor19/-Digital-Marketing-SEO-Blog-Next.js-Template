## Introduction to Modern SEO

The world of Search Engine Optimization is constantly evolving. What worked last year might not be effective today. In 2025, understanding the nuances of AI-generated content, user experience signals, and advanced technical SEO is paramount.

### Core Web Vitals Revisited

Google continues to emphasize Core Web Vitals as a crucial ranking factor. This means focusing on:
* **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** How quickly the main content of a page loads.
* **First Input Delay (FID):** The time it takes for the browser to respond to a user's first interaction.
* **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** The visual stability of a page during loading.

Optimizing these metrics requires a deep dive into your website's performance, image optimization, and efficient loading of resources.

### The Rise of AI in Content Creation

AI tools are transforming how content is produced. While AI can generate vast amounts of text, human oversight remains critical for quality, originality, and E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness).

```javascript
// Example of a simple JavaScript function for performance monitoring
function monitorPerformance() {
  if (performance.getEntriesByType("navigation").length > 0) {
    const [entry] = performance.getEntriesByType("navigation");
    console.log('Largest Contentful Paint:', entry.domContentLoadedEventEnd - entry.fetchStart);
  }
}

monitorPerformance();
```

Remember, a technically flawless website combined with high-quality, user-centric content is the winning formula for SEO in 2025.
